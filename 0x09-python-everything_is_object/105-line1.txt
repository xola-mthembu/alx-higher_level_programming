262
Explanation:

Before line 2 executes, 262 int objects have already been created and are still in memory.
This is due to Python's int object caching mechanism.
CPython pre-allocates and caches int objects for integers in the range from -5 to 256, inclusive.
This optimization improves performance by reusing existing objects instead of creating new ones for frequently used small integers.
The constants NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS define this caching range within the CPython implementation.
Therefore, even though the script hasn't explicitly created any int objects yet, the interpreter has already cached 256 positive integers (-5 to 255) and 6 negative integers (-5 to 0), totaling 262 int objects.
